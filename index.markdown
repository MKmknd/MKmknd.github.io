I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Software Engineering Laboratory (SEL) at the Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan under the supervision of prof. Osamu Mizuno. I am also a Young Scientist of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellowships (DC1) (2019.4-2022.3). I was a visiting researcher in the Software Analysis & Intelligence Lab (SAIL) at Queen's University, Kingston, Canada under the supervision of prof. Ahmed E. Hassan and a Young Ambassador in the "TOBITATE!" program (2018.3-2019.3). My research interests include supporting software developers by providing tools and methods for software quality assurance activities based on software repository mining, machine learning, and statistical analysis techniques. I received my BSc and MSc degrees in Information Science from the Kyoto Institute of Technology (2017 and 2019). More about my work can be read on my publications.
